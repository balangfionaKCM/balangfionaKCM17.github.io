"A Unfinished Document about Myself"
</h2>

<p>
Hi, I'm Fiona Jene Anne C. Balang. You might know me as the President of our section.
I am also called "Nay", "Pres", "Mother", "Bunso", "Huy" and more.
I Live in San Antonio Valley 1. I was born on May 17, 2007.
I like to sing, the color purple and the smell of cooked garlic.
Here's a little something about myself from the past to present.
</p>

<p>
I grew up in the province with my Grandparents.
I had many friends in Batangas, it was so fun being around them.
When I was a kid my parents would visit me every weekend, and everytime My parents arrive I would
hide behind a wall and I would surprise them and laugh.

Years passed and I was Grade 6. It was the day of our graduation.
I arrived, Saw my friends, I waved at them and they waved back.
The ceremony started, The teachers started to call names one by one,
giving out the awards, we sang, we danced, took pictures and finally the sad part.
Everyone saying their goodbyes and all of us parting ways.
</p>

<p>
Another year passed, I was in Grade 7. It was my first day of high school.
A new student at KCMA. I was so nervous going to school and seeing new faces,
not knowing everyone, but my mom and dad and my other relatives told me
"highschool is going to be fun" and yeah It was. I started getting new friends,
experienced reporting, role playing, having field trips without my parents, Going out with my friends etc.
</p>
</div>

<p>
but one day this infectious virus arrives, here comes lockdown, wearing of face masks, 
quarantine passes, social distancing, online classes. big adjustments happened
just because of that virus. half of our high school life was just in front of our screens.
during those 3 years, mental unstableness, self realizations, overthinking, insecurities, lack of social interaction,
lack of sleep, gaming addiction came in. Luckily, I had my cousins, online friends, and my best friend to brighten my day.
</p> 

<p>
Of course I did not just experienced negative things, I also gained as I mentioned online friends, got to
spend more time with my family and myself, gained many likes from my tiktoks, starting to get high grades,
studying hard, I might've gained weight but it's ok. In most parts there were ups and downs, but everything turned
great. It's part of life, you know? some of my memories are a blur, I can't remember most of what happened, so yeah.
</p>

<p>
Basically, I am now a Grade 10 student. The new normal system was announced.
I was going to lose it. I was excited at the same time scared of coming back face to face in school.
Too many thoughts were happening in my mind. yet look at me now, having fun, spending time with my classmates,
going out more often, and is going to graduate and move up.
Buwan ng Wika, Getting 2nd place (comic strip), E-Sports, Intramurals, JS Prom, Interview, Year-End Party,
El Filibusterismo Play, Tests, Examinations. Those circumstances I experienced with my batchmates. It was very fun, I get to do all
those things. I surpassed many challenges in life, in school, and everywhere. More will happen in the
future and I can't wait to meet other opportunities.
